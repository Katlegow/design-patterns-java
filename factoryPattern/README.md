## Factory Design Pattern

	Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface
	for creating objects in a super class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of
	of objects will be created.

1. Useful when you want to encapsulate object creations.
2. Makes refactory so much easier.
